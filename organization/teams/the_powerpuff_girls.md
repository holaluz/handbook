# The PowerPuff Girls (aka TPPG)

## Vision

The PowerPuff Girls acquired the vision of HolaLuz as our own ("Connecting people to green energy"), and we adhered to it through the "people" part, understanding these "people" as "everyone" in Catalunya, Spain and ... the world!

## Mission

So, looking towards that vision, The PowerPuff Girls mission is to **drive and help** post-sale **teams** to **make** their business value **delivery more flexible and focused** so we, as Holaluz, are able to connect as many people as possible to green energy **without being limited by our technologies**

## Team Challenges / Strategy
