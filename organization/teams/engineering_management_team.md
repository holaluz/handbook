# Engineering Management Team (EMT)

## Responsibilities

- To discuss the strategy proposed by the CTO until reach fully alignement and the best posible version of that strategy.

- To define together with the CTO and the business, the OKRs/goals/milestones to be achieved in a determined period by the engineering area.

- To manage hiring pipelines. The open positions are common for the whole engineering area. We do not compete between teams for hiring, we collaborate and bring to Holaluz the best people for the right team and in the right moment. In order to clarify, the possible scenarios are:

	- As EM, I don't need any more people to my team => I help the EMT to filter applicants, push for the experts in my team to help checking technical tests, etc.

	- As EM, I need people for my team and exists an opened position => same as above, but more actively, and collaborate with the rest of EMs involved into taking the best decision for Holaluz.

	- As EM, I need people for my team and there's no opened job position for the required expertise => I actively design the position requirements and with the agreement of the EMT, the CTO and Holaluz People team, we open it.

- To design and execute continuous improvement initiatives that affect more than one team: 360ยบ feedback, general learning processes, growth framework, public handbook, etc.

- We use a [delegation board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPaeVO3RSkNdQ9tycSKE3H-oyk-bIciDu-_hw8O8UW0/edit?usp=sharing) to have a precise and shared vision of the delegation levels in specific responsibilities between the CTO and the EMT.

## Liturgies

That team have a weekly meeting, called the Engineering Managers Weekly, with the following purpose:

- Align the management shared strategy, in the short, mid and long term.
- Assist forum for EMs, to help each other with doubts or tough to handle situations.
- Solve issues between teams that we were not able to fix in the day-to-day or by asincronous ways.
- Meeting where the CTO explains sensitive information that affects to the EMs or that due to its nature, we think it needs to be given to the team with an extra empathy. The rest of general information is shared by written ways, to the whole engineering people by default.
