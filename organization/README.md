# Organization

## Teams

We are organized in multidisciplinary teams around a business value chain. Those teams have the people and expertise needed to be fully autonomous to achieve their goals. Software developers from different backgrounds, data scientists, designers and product owners work together as a team and are self-organized.

Current teams are:

- [Space Unicorns](./teams/space_unicorns_team.md)
- The PowerPuff Girls
- Direct Sales
- Indirect Sales
- Solar
- Customers
- Operations

Also we have a fully dedicated team for technical support related to the company ERP. The Phoenix team.

## Management

- Each purpose team has an [Engineering Manager](./roles/engineering_manager_role.md) (EM), who is fully involved in the day-to-day of the team.
- UX and Data Science expertise people, have their own manager independently of the team they are. Those managers responsibilities are exactly the same than the ones for the team EMs.
- From the management perspective, Product Owners depends on the Projects Office (PMO).
- All the EMs also form an estrategical team called the [Engineering Management Team](./teams/engineering_management_team.md) (EMT).
