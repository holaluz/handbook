# Introduction

At Holaluz we aim to be as transparent as posible.

This handbook helps Holaluz Engineering team to work with the [open by default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_by_default) mindset.

All the information explaining the way we work it's here, and if find that something is missing, all PRs are welcome :blush:


## Vision

As Holaluz our purpose is to create a planet 100% run by green energy. And our vision is to achieve that by connecting people to green energy.

As the Holaluz engineering team, we complement that vision and reinforce it:

**We build the technology to boost the business.**

We understand that Holaluz, as business company, is a great tool to achieve that higher purpose mentioned before, and the technology is an incredibly effective way to boost it.


## Strategy

Our strategy is actually based on the Holaluz values highlighting one in particular: **Always People First**.

We strongly believe that the key to achieve breathtaking high-performance teams is:
- Keeping a [psychological safe environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety).
- Growing an inclusive team.
- Respecting the work-life balance.
- Believing and investing in our personal development as well as in the other's.

Also, we base our strategy in trusting each other, [assuming good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith) and strongly believing in the responsible use of our individual freedom and in the respect of the other's. We are merciless with deliberated attacks to that trust.

We are highly resilient to changes and it is reflected in every thing we do, from the way we organize ourselves to the way we craft our software. We do our best to create as many high quality [feedback loops](https://afontcu.dev/feedback-loops/) as possible.

Having a deep knowledge about users needs and business specs, allows us to achieve the right solution for each case, no less, no more.

Moving on and having fun, is a must.
